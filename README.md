# biblatex-bbl2bib
Takes a `.bbl` file generated by `biblatex` and generates a `.bib` file from it.

Depending on the frontend and backend for the `.bbl` generation, the `.bbl` file may be [formatted differently](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/199642). The `bbl2bib` tool that is included with TeX Live for instance only works on plain `bibtex`-generated `.bbl` files.
